* Canvas on the web is sort of like microsoft paint on the web.
* You get a block of pixels, you don't draw on the canvas but on the context.

* Let variables at the top of the file to specify when you should draw.
* HSL is the rainbow, but you can target specific parts of it.
* Inside canvas object you can use blendmodes.
