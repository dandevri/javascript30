# Array Cardio Day 1

* Get comfortable with all the array methods
* All array methods just loop over every single one

* `filter`: pass it a function loops over items in array and we can keep it.
* `map`: takes an array it does something with and return new array of the same length. Always return the same amount of items.
* `sort`: You get two items, just sort those two. Put older topper on top.
* `reduce`: build something on every single item. It gives a running total. Total is first undefined

* You can use queryselector on different dom elements, not always the document.
* Spread will take the item out of something (iterable) and puts it in array.
