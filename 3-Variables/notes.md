# CSS Variables

* CSS variables can be updated in JavaScript
* This can't be done with Sass, cause it's compiled.

* You declare the CSS variables on some sort of element. In this case `:root`.
* :root it in some way similar to the HTML element
* The dashes (syntax) make sure the css is backwards compatibile.

* Document queryselector will give you a nodelist not an array.
* Array has different methods on it, nodelist doesn't.
* You can specify variables on specific elements, like cascading.
